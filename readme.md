# Cracking the Coding Interview Question Repo
This meager repository is for the express purpose of sharpening those skills that many code camp graduates and self taught job seekers of Software Engineering lack. Namely, the ability to assess a technical issue, recognize/plan an angle of attack for a problem, and optimizing this solution. All of which are exemplified in the modern technical interview. Albeit with the caveat that it is by its own structure a method of gate-keeping.
